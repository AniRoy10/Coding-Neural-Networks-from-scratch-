In this Project we have coded a Simple Neural network from ground up solely using Numpy and Math.

After that used that as a model to make predicts on MNIST dataset and got 89% test accuracy.

created seperate functions for:

Parameter (weights and biases) initialization
Forward Propagation 
Backward Propagation
Parameter Updates 
Gradient descent
